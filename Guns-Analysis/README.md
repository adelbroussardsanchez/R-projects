# Gun Control Laws and Gun-Related Crime Analysis (R)

## Overview
This was my first data analysis project and focused on exploring the relationship between gun control laws and gun-related crime rates across the United States. The goal was to test my own hypothesis that stricter gun laws are linked to lower levels of gun-related crime. I used statistical analysis and visualizations to explore patterns and relationships in the data.

## Project Goals
- Explore how gun laws relate to gun-related crime rates  
- Test whether stricter laws are associated with fewer crimes  
- Practice data cleaning, visualization, and regression analysis  
- Learn how to evaluate assumptions behind statistical models

### Dataset
- **Dataset Description**  
  Overview of the dataset, including where it came from and what it measures.

- **Cleaning the Data**  
  Steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, including fixing inconsistencies and handling missing values.

- **Variable Description**  
  Explanation of the main variables, including gun law measures and crime rates.

### Purpose and Expectations
The purpose of this project was to test a clear hypothesis: that stricter gun laws lead to fewer gun-related crimes. I expected to see a negative relationship between law strictness and crime rates, but relied on the analysis to evaluate whether that expectation held up.

## Analysis

### Categorical Variables
- **Bar Plots**  
  Used to compare crime rates across different categories.

- **Contingency Tables**  
  Used to examine how categorical variables relate to one another.

- **Boxplots**  
  Used to compare distributions of crime rates across groups.

- **Heatmaps**  
  Used to visualize patterns across states and categories.

### Numerical Variables
- **Scatter Plots and Correlation Matrices**  
  Used to explore relationships between numerical variables.

- **Summary Statistics**  
  Used to understand averages and variability in the data.

- **Histograms and Density Plots**  
  Used to examine how crime rates are distributed.

- **Shapiro–Wilk Test**  
  Used to check whether variables followed a normal distribution.

- **Q–Q Plots**  
  Used as a visual check of distribution assumptions.

## Modeling

### Multiple Regression
Built regression models to see how multiple factors together relate to gun-related crime rates and to understand the relative impact of gun laws.

## Summary
This project helped me connect a real-world policy question to data analysis. The results show how gun laws and crime rates relate in the data, while also highlighting the limits of what can be concluded from observational data.
